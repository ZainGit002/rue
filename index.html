      <h2>To the Sweetest Girl</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve been thinking about how lucky I am to have met you, someone so
        kind, so intelligent, so ambitious, so hardworking, and most of all, so
        beautiful.
        <br /><br />
        The way you care about your people, the way you show up for others, the
        way you make even simple moments feel special for everyone, it doesn’t
        go unnoticed.
        <br /><br />
        From the moment we met, there was something about you that stayed with
        me, something that you never find in most people, and I knew from that
        moment that I wanted something more than just to be your friend.
        <br /><br />
        The more I got to know you, the more I realized that you would be my
        person. The way we think, the we way go about most things, our choices,
        our favorites, and even our shared trauma, all of it just made me feel
        closer and closer to you.
        <br /><br />
        I adore all of you, your maturity, your emotional intelligence, the
        nonchalant act that you put up, the little moments when you act cute,
        the crashouts you have now and then, and the way you are so elegently
        beautiful, everything about you.
        <br /><br />
        I wanted you to know that I see you for you. I value you. I want your
        prescene in my life, and I’d really like the chance to build something
        special with you.
        <br /><br />
        – Zain
